- Improvements made:

	- Initialize radar values
		- derive px, py, vx, and vy from the initial data 
			- experimented with having vx, vy to 0 and using the derived values. It seems using derived values gave the reduced rmse for vx and vy (0.58, 0.8 vs 0.58, 0.81)
	- Normalize theta values 
		- make sure the theta values betweek -pi to pi
	- 


Results:
    - with radar init data, normalized phi values: .23, .34, .58, .80

H_laser init probelm. Once this is init, then the values are fine: .098, 0.085, 0.44. 0.46
